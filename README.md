# Breast-Cancer-Detection
A breast cancer detection system has been implemented using the dataset from an article by Hooda et al., achieving an accuracy of 99% and a precision of 97%. This project utilized various Machine Learning algorithms, with the best results obtained from Extra Trees, a type of Ensemble Learning.

To address the data imbalance issue, the SMOTE algorithm was applied, and a balanced bagging model was trained and tested. The result of the balanced bagging classifier was 98%.

The file "breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb" explores different ML algorithms, including Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Extra Trees, with the latter yielding the most promising results.

The file "BreastCancerPrediction_GeneticAlgorithm.ipynb" employs Genetic Algorithms to find the optimized parameters. The results of the best models were compared at the end.
